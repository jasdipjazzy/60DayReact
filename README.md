60 Days of React: A Learning Journey 🚀
Welcome to my repository for the #60DaysOfReact challenge! This is my personal commitment to intensively learn and master React.js over a 60-day period, from September 11, 2025, to November 10, 2025.

This repository serves as a public journal, a code log, and a portfolio of the projects I build along the way. I'll be documenting my daily progress, challenges, and key learnings here.

The Goal
The primary objective is to transition from foundational knowledge to building and deploying complex, production-ready React applications. By the end of this journey, I aim to have a deep and practical understanding of the React ecosystem.

Key Objectives:
[ ] Master React fundamentals (Components, JSX, Props, State).

[ ] Achieve proficiency with React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, etc.).

[ ] Implement client-side routing with React Router.

[ ] Manage application state effectively using tools like Redux Toolkit or Zustand.

[ ] Interact with REST APIs for data fetching, creation, and updates.

[ ] Write clean, reusable, and maintainable code.

[ ] Build and deploy at least 3 portfolio-worthy projects.

Tech Stack
This journey will focus on the modern React ecosystem.

Core Technologies:

Framework/Library: ⚛️ React.js

Build Tool: ⚡ Vite

Language: 📜 JavaScript (ES6+) & potentially TypeScript

Styling: 💅 CSS Modules, Styled-Components, or Tailwind CSS
